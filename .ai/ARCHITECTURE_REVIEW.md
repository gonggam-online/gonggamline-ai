# Architecture review

## Story compliance gate

Answer before implementation:

1. Which approved domain and boundary own the change?
2. What existing source of truth, API, DTO, database, Queue, or lifecycle is used?
3. Does the Story introduce a new Domain, Database, Migration, Queue,
   Lifecycle, Public API, or External Integration?
4. Are dependency direction, security, failure handling, observability, tests,
   rollout, and rollback compliant with the blueprint?
5. Is the evidence recorded in the Story and Decision Log?

If questions 1, 2, 4, or 5 are unresolved, compliance fails. If question 3 is
yes, implementation must stop unless the required Architecture Story is already
completed and approved.

## Architecture Story minimum content

- problem, business objective, owner, and non-goals;
- current-state evidence and alternatives considered;
- domain ownership and dependency diagram;
- contracts, DTOs, data model, state/lifecycle, and external boundaries;
- security/privacy, failure modes, idempotency, recovery, and observability;
- compatibility, migration/deployment order, test strategy, and capacity;
- rollout, rollback, decision, approver, and approval date.

Approval means a recorded owner/AI CTO decision in
[`DECISION_LOG.md`](DECISION_LOG.md), not merely the existence of a draft.
Architecture approval does not waive [`RISK_POLICY.md`](RISK_POLICY.md).

## Approved Architecture Stories

### 2026-07-27 — Domeggook Read-only Supplier Catalog Adapter v1

- Status: approved by repository-owner AI CTO directive.
- Boundary: new read-only External Integration owned by Supplier/Procurement.
- Public API: safe Domeggook health contract approved.
- Database / Migration / Queue: none.
- Risk: normal-risk for this documentation-only Architecture Story.
- Implementation authorization: limited to the Definition of Done and
  exclusions in
  [Domeggook Read-only Supplier Catalog Adapter v1](../docs/architecture/DOMEGGOOK-READONLY-SUPPLIER-CATALOG-ADAPTER-V1.md).
- Decision record: [`DECISION_LOG.md`](DECISION_LOG.md#2026-07-27--domeggook-read-only-supplier-catalog-adapter-v1).

### 2026-07-27 — Domeggook Live Search v1

- Status: approved by repository-owner task directive.
- Boundary: Supplier / Procurement read-only application and public API.
- Database / Migration / Queue: none.
- Risk: normal-risk.
- Implementation authorization: limited to the no-persistence endpoint, UI,
  and tests in
  [Domeggook Live Search v1](../docs/architecture/DOMEGGOOK-LIVE-SEARCH-V1.md).
- Decision record:
  [`DECISION_LOG.md`](DECISION_LOG.md#2026-07-27--domeggook-live-search-v1).

### 2026-07-27 — Item Selection Evaluation v1

- Status: approved by repository-owner task directive.
- Boundary: Supplier / Procurement Item Selection application use case, with
  Revenue remaining the financial-rule owner.
- Public API / Database / Lifecycle: contracts approved for later ordered
  implementation; no runtime route, migration, or Production change is
  authorized by this documentation PR.
- Existing Live Search: remains bounded, read-only, and persistence-free.
- Risk: normal-risk for this documentation-only Architecture Story. Later
  financial, auth/RLS, migration, and Production Stories are high-risk/manual.
- Implementation authorization: limited to the ordered Stories and
  prerequisites in
  [Item Selection Evaluation v1](../docs/architecture/ITEM-SELECTION-EVALUATION-V1.md#14-implementation-stories).
- Decision record:
  [`DECISION_LOG.md`](DECISION_LOG.md#2026-07-27--item-selection-evaluation-v1).

### 2026-07-28 — Item Selection Database Baseline Architecture v1

- Status: Accepted by repository owner on 2026-07-28.
- Approved head SHA:
  `8b1e6ab589491e77dfa7ac5d71c99b40db03030a`.
- Boundary: Database / Security contract for immutable Item Selection
  evaluation history.
- Decision: retain Supabase Postgres; preserve authoritative
  round-trip decimal values and canonical UTF-8 text bytes; use scaled integers
  and JSONB only as non-authoritative query projections; keep append-only
  evaluations and transactional idempotent finalization.
- Implementation authorization: none until the separately required Sprint B-0
  and Admin Identity / Authorization / RLS / CSRF Architecture are accepted.
  No migration, database connection, runtime code, API, UI, auth, RLS, or
  Production execution is authorized by this acceptance.
- Story:
  [Item Selection Database Baseline Architecture v1](../docs/architecture/ITEM-SELECTION-DATABASE-BASELINE-V1.md).
- Decision record:
  [`DECISION_LOG.md`](DECISION_LOG.md#2026-07-28--item-selection-database-baseline-architecture-v1).

## Proposed Architecture Stories

### 2026-07-27 — Sprint B-0 Database Baseline Execution v1

- Status: proposed; repository-owner manual approval required.
- Boundary: Database / Security; isolated fresh replay only.
- Production: no access or mutation authorized.
- Critical ordering: preserve migrations 003–020 and place the final
  least-privilege security boundary after migration 020.
- Implementation authorization: none until this Story is manually approved.
- Story:
  [Sprint B-0 Database Baseline Execution v1](../docs/architecture/SPRINT-B0-DATABASE-BASELINE-EXECUTION-V1.md).

### 2026-07-28 — Admin Identity, Authorization, RLS, and CSRF Architecture v1

- Status: proposed; repository-owner manual approval required.
- Boundary: Application Security / Database Security for the single-company
  administrator surface.
- Principal proposal: verified Supabase Auth `sub` UUID with
  `user_role=admin`, versioned authorization, active-registry cross-check,
  direct protected-table DML revoked, mandatory AAL2 mutation RPCs, user-JWT
  RLS, and session-bound signed same-origin CSRF.
- Review follow-up: independent blockers were addressed with an administrator /
  TOTP state machine, exact JWT refresh/revocation, protected-object matrix,
  dedicated function ownership, supported `@supabase/ssr@0.12.3` browser/server
  cookie contract, maintenance-window cutover, and audit retention/failure
  semantics. A second review added the self-only pending-MFA activation
  bootstrap, five-operation server-only Auth control plane, bounded
  direct-unenroll exposure, mandatory telemetry-provider prerequisite, and
  pinned SSR/supabase-js session cleanup contract. The revised exact head still
  requires independent review and explicit owner acceptance of the remaining
  60-second MFA-unenroll exposure.
- Third review follow-up: protected PostgREST mutations now expose only minimal
  `api` wrappers while all `private` objects remain hidden; Auth control-plane
  operations map to exact pinned-SDK APIs and explicitly reject a fictional
  target-sub-only global sign-out; and a 30-second maximum database-visible
  telemetry lease makes direct RPCs fail closed independently of application
  flags. The new exact head remains Proposed and requires independent review.
- Current-state finding: application routes have no accepted administrator
  session or CSRF boundary and rely on anonymous Supabase access with broad
  development policies.
- Risk: high-risk/manual because the decisions govern auth, authorization, RLS,
  secrets, and Production access.
- Implementation authorization: none until repository-owner acceptance.
- Story:
  [Admin Identity, Authorization, RLS, and CSRF Architecture v1](../docs/architecture/ADMIN-IDENTITY-AUTHORIZATION-RLS-CSRF-V1.md).
- Decision record:
  [`DECISION_LOG.md`](DECISION_LOG.md#2026-07-28--admin-identity-authorization-rls-and-csrf-architecture-v1).

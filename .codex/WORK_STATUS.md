# Work status

## Current task snapshot

- Objective: implement the Sprint 2 Revenue Calculation Engine from existing
  Product data, with deterministic states, an opt-in Product API DTO, tests,
  and documentation.
- Branch: `codex/feat/revenue-calculation-engine`
- Risk: high-risk because repository policy classifies pricing and margin
  calculation changes as high-risk; `manual-merge-required`, no auto-merge.
- Root-cause class: code/capability gap. Product inputs exist, but no shared
  strict calculation/readiness contract existed.
- Scope: pure calculations, Product mapper, opt-in read DTO, tests, docs.
- Non-goals: migrations, DB writes, ROI invention, Revenue Score,
  Competition/Discovery/Workflow/Runtime changes.
- Completed: fast-forwarded to merged PR #13; audited readiness/schema/code and
  Next.js 16 guidance; implemented calculation, state/evidence model, mapper,
  opt-in API response, tests, contract docs, and Sprint 2 changelog.
- Current work: commit/push/Draft PR and exact-commit Preview validation.
- Blockers/owner actions: none. Unknown Production nullability is represented
  as `incomplete` or `invalid` rather than assumed.
- Changed files: `lib/revenue/calculation.ts`,
  `app/api/products/route.ts`, `tests/revenue-calculation.test.ts`,
  `docs/revenue-calculation.md`, `CHANGELOG-Sprint2.md`, and this file.
- Results: targeted Revenue tests 12 passed; typecheck passed; lint passed with
  warnings only from pre-existing untracked Playwright output; full unit suite
  passed; production build passed. Local `/` and `/revenue` rendered meaningful
  headings with no browser console errors. Default and opt-in Product API calls
  returned HTTP 200 with the preserved unconfigured-Supabase response.
- Last commit: no task commit yet; branch base `0f7dd37`.
- Exact next action: stage only task files, commit, push, and create a high-risk
  Draft PR with `manual-merge-required`.
- Remaining risks: stored cost provenance/freshness is absent; fee amount/rate
  precedence remains intentionally unresolved on conflict; ROI is undefined.

## Previous task snapshot

## Objective

Audit Product Data Readiness for the Revenue Opportunity Engine and make only
the minimum evidence-backed changes without affecting Runtime behavior.

## Current branch

`codex/feat/revenue-data-readiness`

## Risk level

Normal-risk. This task changes documentation only. It does not change schema,
price/margin calculations, APIs, Competition, AI, Workflow, or Runtime.

## Scope and non-goals

- Audit Product, Competition, Market, Supplier, and Revenue schema evidence.
- Classify required Revenue inputs as present, missing, needed, or unnecessary.
- Audit `/api/products` and Competition API exposure.
- Do not add a migration without evidence from the actual database.
- Do not change recommendation algorithms, AI logic, workflow, or Runtime.

## Root-cause class

Database readiness/contract gap. The repository lacks the initial `products`
DDL, so core-column nullability cannot be verified locally. Existing fields
cover most numeric inputs, while provenance, authoritative relationships, and
ROI semantics are not yet defined.

## Completed work

- Confirmed a clean non-main branch and corrected its duplicated prefix.
- Read the mandatory repository, risk, delivery, browser, and Next.js route
  handler guidance.
- Audited Product storage/read/update paths and related TypeScript consumers.
- Audited Product, Competition, Market Intelligence, Supplier, and Revenue
  migrations.
- Confirmed `/api/products` already returns all stored Product and Competition
  fields.
- Determined that migration/API/type changes are not currently justified.
- Added the Revenue Data Readiness report and Sprint 2 changelog.

## Current work

Implementation, local verification, delivery, and exact-commit Preview
validation are complete. Draft PR #13 is awaiting review.

## Blockers and owner actions

Actual `products` schema/nullability and Production data completeness require a
read-only Supabase inspection. No Supabase connection is configured in the
workspace, and the repository contains only an environment example.

Owner inspection path if no automated read-only connection is available:
Supabase Dashboard > project > Table Editor > `products` (columns/defaults/
nullable), then SQL Editor for aggregate null/zero/freshness counts. Project
URL and anon/service keys must remain secret and must not be pasted into the
report or committed.

## Changed files

- `docs/reports/REVENUE-DATA-READINESS.md`
- `CHANGELOG-Sprint2-Product-Data-Readiness.md`
- `.codex/WORK_STATUS.md`

## Commands and test results

- Repository/schema/API/type audit: completed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run lint`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm.cmd test`: 15 passed, 0 failed.
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed; 65 route entries generated.
- Manual read-only browser checks: `/`, `/competition`, and `/revenue` rendered
  meaningful headings/content; no captured browser console errors.
- `GET /api/products`: HTTP 200 with the documented unconfigured response
  (`available: false`, empty products).
- `npm.cmd run test:e2e:local`: 17 passed, 7 failed. All 7 failures are the
  existing external-configuration condition caused by absent local Supabase
  configuration. Affected routes: `/listing`, `/market`, `/procurement`,
  `/revenue`, `/sourcing`, `/workflow`, and `/workspace`. Revenue-critical
  checks, Product API health, `/`, and `/competition` passed. Failure evidence
  is under `test-results/`.
- GitHub CI run `30140610196`: passed for exact commit `feb70ba`.
- Exact-commit Vercel Preview:
  `https://gonggamline-aupgdmwcl-gg-online.vercel.app`.
- Preview browser run `30140610218`: 24 passed; no reported page, console, API,
  or failed-request errors.
- Preview evidence: `preview-browser-evidence`, artifact `8614330437`.
- Production: unchanged because PR #13 is open and unmerged.

## Last commit

`4add6a7 docs: audit revenue product data readiness`, followed by merge commit
`feb70ba` to incorporate the latest `origin/main` without force-pushing.

## Exact next action

Review Draft PR #13. Before a later Revenue calculation implementation,
perform the documented read-only Supabase schema and completeness inspection.

## Remaining risks

- Actual database nullability may differ from application assumptions.
- Existing zero/default values may mean unknown rather than measured zero.
- Product, market product, and supplier identities are not authoritatively
  linked for Revenue Opportunity calculation.
- ROI and cost provenance require business/data-contract approval before
  implementation.
